# ProsperWorks-Ruby

A lightweight wrapper for interacting with the [ProsperWorks Developer API](https://www.prosperworks.com/developer_api).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soccernee/prosperworks-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soccernee/prosperworks-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prosperworks-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prosperworks-ruby

## Usage

This gem offers basic operations to interact with the ProsperWorks Developer API. There is minimal error handling and no validation logic.

To use the proper credentials, the following must be run before using the gem:

```
ProsperWorks.configure do |config|
  config.user_email = <your_user_email>
  config.access_token = <your_api_token>
end
```

### Create

```
person = ProsperWorks::Person.create(attributes)

opportunity = ProsperWorks::Opportunity.create({
  pipeline_id: <some_id>,
  company_id: <another_id>,
  monetary_value: 1_000
})

```

### Find

```
person = ProsperWorks::Person.find(id)

lead = ProsperWorks::Lead.find(423)
```

### Update

For update, either update the object in advance:

```
person.name = "A New Name"
response = ProsperWorks::Person.update(person)
```

or pass in a hash of attributes to update:

```
attributes = {
  name: "A New Name"
}
response = ProsperWorks::Person.update(person, attributes)

```

### Delete

```
response = ProsperWorks::Person.delete(person.id)

```
### Search

```
response = ProsperWorks::Person.search(name: "John Doe")
```

### List

```
webhooks = ProsperWorks::Webhook.list
```

The following entity types are currently supported for create, find, update, delete and search:
* Person
* Lead
* Company
* Opportunity
* Task
* Project

The following entity types are currently supported for list:
* Customer Source
* Pipeline
* Pipeline Stage
* Webhook

The response will either be an instance of `ProsperWorks::Errors`, or the entity itself. See the `handle_response` function in [connect.rb](lib/prosperworks/api_operations/connect.rb).


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive Ruby shell.

### `bin/console`

To use the gem in an interactive Ruby shell, you can run `bin/console`. To include your ProsperWorks API credentials (`user_name` and `access_token`) you can either:

1. Use ENV variables:
```
USER_EMAIL=<your_email> ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_access_token> bin/console
```
2. Store them in a text file named `.pw_credentials.txt` in the root directory of this repository. The first line must be your user_email and the second line must be your access_token. Nothing else may be in this file. At startup, `bin/console` will read and use these values. And this file *must not* be checked into git; it has been included in `.gitignore` for this very reason.

### Local Installation

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
